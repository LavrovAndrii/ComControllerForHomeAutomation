# ComControllerForHomeAutomation
The Windows Forms program is created in Visual Studio 2017 Enterprise with C# and .NET for controlling the power of home devices by using a USB connection through the COM 3 port with the Arduino UNO R3 card driver. The board controls an 8-channel shield relay that switches on or off the power supply on home appliances.

To successfully launch the program, you need to install Visual Studio 2015 or a later version of the program. To run correctly, you must have .NET Framework 4.6.1 installed and the C # compiler, which is usually installed with Visual Studio.
To start a project, you need to open the project using Visual Studio and run the project to run. The compiler will automatically generate the .exe program.
